# Asteroids

Whole lot going on here.

So to start vue.js app I am using the vue cli

# Install npm
...

# Install vue cli on local machine globally (-g)
npm install -g @vue/cli

# Create app project structure
vue create asteroids-vue

# Insert stuff you did here

# Doesn't appear to update on the fly need to take down and relaunch
docker-compose down

# Used to verify nothing else is running
docker ps
